Very soon afterwards , Vassilis was offered a very well-paid job with Anderson Consulting . So I was left holding the baby ... I had to learn about Unix rather quickly : I was determined that we would go on in the way that we had planned , but my knowledge at that time was distinctly limited . I once again installed Linux at home and began to learn something about it while continuing to play with FreeBSD at school .
