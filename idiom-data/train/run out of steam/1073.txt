It 's now well over a year since Sabre Man first appeared , and the concept is wearing a little thin . Nightshade looks a lot different from Knight Lore and Alien 8 , but not so different as to stifle doubts that Ultimate may be running out of steam . Or dare we hope for something really special this side of Christmas ?
