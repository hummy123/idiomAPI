Learners enrol at a time in their lives that provides both an impetus for learning ( perhaps from children , work or community life ) , and an opportunity ( time , support , barriers overcome ) . Learners stay engaged for as long as suits them ; they may leave when they feel they have ' enough ' skills , when their personal circumstances change , when the barriers to learning are greater than the supports , or when they just run out of steam for a while . They may come back months or years later .
