The car pulls like a train even at 90-100mph I can still drop it down to 4th and just toe it ! I find that I back off before the car runs out of steam . The SSK2 has got to be a modification even Rover should consider from the factory it makes the car a " Real sports cars " and a " Drivers machine " not a hairdressers car as so many people like to refer to them as .
