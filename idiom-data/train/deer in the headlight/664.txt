) vendor relations people , contact Fry 's management to arrange a similar event to the Windows 98 launch . Needless to say I was like a deer in the headlights , I told him that , in fact , Linux was a free operating system , and that this was one way we saw to market it ( not to mention the fact that no company could match a MS launch when it comes down to the checkbook ) . He was visibly upset , so I thought it was best to stop talking with him at this point .
