My first selection came from this winery . White wines Villa Wolf , Pinot Gris 12.5 % 2002 , Pfalz Germany Sainsburys í‰Œ£ 4.99 An unusual grape for Germany produces a most pleasant wine that has an inviting nose , and an off dry peaches and cream taste that guarantees a hit with friends . Try this out í‰äóÖblind ' on your wine buff neighbour .
