I could n't agree more with Monbiot 's and Pilger 's opposition to the bombing of Afghanistan . A couple of days after the terrorist attacks on American targets , I wrote that I would shed no tears if , having established Osama bin Laden 's guilt , the US were to drop a bomb on his headquarters . I stick by that statement despite my basic pacifism and opposition to militarism .
