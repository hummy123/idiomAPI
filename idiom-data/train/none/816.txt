You can drive on the motorway from the Channel - it 's not the outskirts of Paris by any means , you can see the Eiffel Tower half a mile away - on their equivalent of our circular road . You can circle Paris if you want to , and you can pick up the motorway going south without stopping at a single traffic light . It 's an enormous complex of interchanges and multilevel high-speed avenues , and the French seem to drive much more aggressively than people do over here .
