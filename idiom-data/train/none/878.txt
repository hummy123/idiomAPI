We were not perhaps as much on our guard as we should have been , seduced by the attractive housing and pretty gardens , and so , when we went through a bridge and saw a group of boys aged ten to twelve , we did n't take much notice . But with them was an older boy and he made to jump on the boat as it was going under the bridge . Fortunately he thought better of it-- I think it was just too far away for him to do it .
