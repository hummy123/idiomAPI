Made from 100 % cotton these have a sort of canvas feel like real army trousers . All the pockets have velcro fastening and they have the word " GASP " written in a gothic style on the arris below the belt loops , really good if you want the ladies ( or whatever takes your fancy I suppose ! ) to notice your butt !
