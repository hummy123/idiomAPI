All the time we 'd been travelling south from Chamonix I 'd been noticing the mixture of colours in the woodland . It looked as if autumn was on its way , and undoubtedly it was , but becaue we were going south I thought that evidence of autumn should have been decreasing . Up to a certain height above a valley floor all was green , then browns appeared and eventually every tree higher up the slope , where there was less water and probably less soil , had brown leaves .
