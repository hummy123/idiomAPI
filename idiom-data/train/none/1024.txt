It would be like going to a pub and having an advertiser throwing things into your conversation . No one minds the ads at the bar , on the walls of the pub , on the TV screen , in the toilet , etc. but you do n't want an advertiser directly intruding on your conversation . The web might be different to the real world in many ways , but there are some rules of acceptable behaviour that still translate reasonably well .
