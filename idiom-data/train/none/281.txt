At most hostels , small chores were allocated to be completed before leaving , depending on visitor numbers , usually washing up and cleaning , including toilets , chopping wood and bringing in the coal , or preparing vegetables . The meals at teatime were adequate and spartan packed lunches could usually be purchased , mostly two sandwiches , a piece of cake or fruit and a tin of orangeade . It was the first time I had encountered brown sugar sandwiches .
