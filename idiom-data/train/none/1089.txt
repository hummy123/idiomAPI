I turned my lantern down the long , straight passage , and there was the fat man , running like the wind , with a smear of blood across his face , and close at his heels , bounding like a tiger , the great black-bearded Sikh , with a knife flashing in his hand . I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant . He was gaining on the Sikh , and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet .
