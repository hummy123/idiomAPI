Few dragonflies , but the common one was a hawker with a royal blue body and apple green thorax and eyes . Several large spiders including one in the toilet at Ampijoroa , and other thick-bodied beasts with webs over running water . Giraffe-necked Weevils ( male and female ) and green stick insects , mostly at Perinet .
