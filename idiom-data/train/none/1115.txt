Miss Mayes told the court she saw Mr George at 7am on the day of the murder , standing in the rain in Gowan Avenue , Fulham , a few yards from the spot where the 37-year-old was shot . She was on her way to a Tube station when she noticed a car double-parked almost directly opposite the scene of the crime and saw a man standing alongside . " When I first saw him , he was just standing there , looking at the houses on his left , " she said .
