If it is dirty , with a flushable liner , you just flush the liner and contents down the loo . If you are using a fleece liner , then the poo will normally fall quite easily off the liner , or if it is sticking then you can hold the liner ( and nappy if necessary ) in the toilet and flush . Then every day or two , you will do a load of washing .
