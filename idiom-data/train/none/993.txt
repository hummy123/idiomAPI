I took my girlfriend to a game in its inaugural season . After 10 overs or so , she decided that tipping red wine all over herself and hiding in the toilet for an hour would be preferable to the action in the middle . Mind you , we were at Worcester and sitting in front of some deranged , bellowing old scrumpyhead going by the name of Captain Crazy ( with the hat , t-shirt and business cards to prove it ) , so it was vaguely understandable .
