As passengers watched for a replacement engine , one passenger remarked to me that this situation was making an anorak of everyone ; I explained that whilst I was an anorak , I had left the said garment behind on account of the weather . Another lady asked me if the loco that had just gone south through the centre road was for our train . Without getting too technical , I explained that 92 022 would have one or two problems getting to Holyhead !
