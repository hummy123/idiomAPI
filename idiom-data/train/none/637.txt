It seems so much fresher to me , and sweeter too , as I pass the street vendors in the markets , hot fresh doughnuts here , roasted chestnuts there , mulled wine just ahead . I love the tingling as the blood rushes back to my face and hands when I come in from the cold . I love warming my hands on cartons of food bought from one of the many stalls in Camden Market and finding a spot on a wall somewhere to transfer the warmth inside .
