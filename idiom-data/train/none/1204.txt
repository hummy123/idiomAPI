My last experience of Morocco in Fez had been a bit arduousí‰äó_.especially as there was no hot water , except for in the hammam , where I was bent double and beaten black and blue by a so called masseur ! I could see the lights of Tangiers twinkling on a dusky horizon and I wondered . Would the overnight sleeper train that would whisk me down through the arid red deserts to Marrakesh be like the Orient Express ?
