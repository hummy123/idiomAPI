60 metres on I was getting close to thirds . The passage had stayed more or less the same up to here - about 1 metre high , 2 metres wide as far as I could tell ( visibility was typically about two feet , four feet in the good patches ) . Now a particularly big silt bank seemed to fill the passage , heaped up on the left side ; there looked to be a fairly narrow gap over the top .
