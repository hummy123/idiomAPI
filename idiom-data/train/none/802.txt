On the Gosport side the pipeline makes landfall near Foxbury Point in Fleetlands . From here it goes south through Bedenham , RNAD Frater , Priddy 's Hard , and under Forton Lake to the Oil Fuel Depot . A booster pump house was located just behind the North Star Pub , and was kept in running order until it was demolished in the 1990s .
