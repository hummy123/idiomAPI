Ladies ' conveniences were adequate but below average on cleaning and maintenance . The general smell in the toilets was n't too bad , although in one trap , someone had recently chundered and the resultant pavement pizza could be smelled from well outside the doorway . Overall the toilets at Newcastle were reasonable if inconsistent .
