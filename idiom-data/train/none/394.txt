Truly there were giants in the land . Into the library for a flick through Poucher 's Scottish Peaks - his walking routes drawn onto photographs in thick white roadpainter 's lines - before pressing on northward past a grassed-over reservoir where a trig point sat behind bars like some caged zoo animal . I crossed the railway again : the meandering , lived-in backline between Edinburgh and Glasgow .
