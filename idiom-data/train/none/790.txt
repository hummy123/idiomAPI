On the map I have indicated there is a door that leads south to the armoury and initially this door will be closed . Also , I intend that the armoury will be a dark location , where you will need a light source to be able to see , and therefore going south from location 1 and north from location 2 will be dependant on two of the FLAGS which PAW uses . So , the connections entry for loc 1 will be : { E 3 W 6 U 5 } .
