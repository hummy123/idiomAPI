Years later I found a letter in a Newspaper which was from a Mr Howell - ( Possibly CPO Howell ) - I think the letter was wrongly headed í‰äóÖAn Ajax Veteran remembers ' . The facts , appear to fit the í‰äóÖExeter ' not í‰äóÖAjax ' ( Exeter went south to the Falklands and returned to Plymouth ) . Many books have been written about the battle , but this letter shows the views of one who took part .
