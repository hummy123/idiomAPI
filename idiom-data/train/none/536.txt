The carrier is n't a particularly effective thing for bringing round someones house of an evening , as there 's no way to close the top and hold the chips in place and it 's pretty heavy . It 's more to hold the chips nice in a cupboard or something and bring to the table for a game . Nice that it 's wood with a brass handle , makes it look far better quality than something made of plastic .
