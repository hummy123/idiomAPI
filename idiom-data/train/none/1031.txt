We help the elderly and disabled people of Swansea with painting work and gardening that they caní€Œ¢í‰ä‰åí‰ä‹¢t manage themselves . Have you ever seen six people crammed into a 4m x 2.5m bathroom , attempting to paint it without falling in the toilet ? You doní€Œ¢í‰ä‰åí‰ä‹¢t need any special skills to be able to help , just a few spare hours on a Wednesday afternoon .
