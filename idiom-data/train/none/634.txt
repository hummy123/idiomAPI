Needless to say , faced with choosing between fruit tea in a cardboard box , and fruit tea in a balsawood house ... I chose the house . The tea ( apricot and peach ) is wonderful , and sweetened a little with honey is just the thing when coming in from the cold . They also sell Reese 's pieces ( I know they 're as common as muck over in yankland , but here they 're a rarity ) for 42p .
