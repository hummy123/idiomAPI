Back in the un-saddling enclosure Nicky , as the rest of us , was sorely disappointed yet slightly perplexed at the result . Yes , we were carrying a lot of weight and 5lbs more than at Newbury and on much quicker ground but this would not have been enough to explain it . Especially bearing in mind that the horse that came second - At Your Request - we beat last time out and carrying the same weight difference .
