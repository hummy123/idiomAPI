Calves are crammed into dark , wooden boxes so small that they cannot turn around . Motherless and alone , they suffer from anaemia , diarrhoea , pneumonia and lameness and see the light of day only on their way to slaughter . Veal crates will be phased out in the EU in 2008 , but veal production will remain .
