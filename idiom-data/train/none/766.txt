The American Admiral in charge of all operations in the Far East was I think , named Fife and he had a great love for submariners . So we set off , our first port of call was Gibraltar , then through the Med onto Malta , Suez , Port Said and after sailing through the canal we eventually ended up in Trincomalee . From this point on we had to be on our guard as the Japanese still had many surface ships operating in these waters .
