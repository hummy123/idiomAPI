Turn right along the A500 , take the third exit at the next roundabout . Shortly after this go under the railway bridge and turn left at the roundabout immediately after this bridge . Continue along beside the railway line to a set of traffic lights ( very near the railway station ) and bear right across these into Leek Road , following the signs for the A52 and Ashbourne .
