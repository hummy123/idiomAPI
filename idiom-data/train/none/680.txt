I remember listening to the radio broadcast in 1945 : ' a bomb has been dropped on Hiroshima , equal to 20,000 tonnes of TNT ' . I remember rushing out as a child and telling my next door neighbour : ' They 've dropped a bomb equal to 20,000 tonnes of TNT. ' Well , from then on , of course , life became very worrying . I remember the Cuban Missile Crisis , I was a teacher then .
