Lobster omelette Thermidor ( í‰Œ£ 9.00 ) scored ten out of ten for flavour and tenderness of the lobster , but it was neither omelette nor Thermidor , unless your interpretation of either genre is hugely liberal . It was brought to the table in an attractive little pan - sensuously gooey , in texture more like a softly scrambled egg or even a savoury brulí€Œ©e . I was told that this is currently their favourite dish .
