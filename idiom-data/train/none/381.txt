My College is late in the order of Colleges and my other graduands appreciate a leisurely lunch . Instead of being my guest of honour at lunch and walking with me at the head of the procession to the Senate House , which is what I should prefer , my higher graduand very likely has lunch , í€Œæ deux , with my press-ganged deputy . On a bad day this lunch might be at their own expense in one of Cambridge 's fast-food outlets .
