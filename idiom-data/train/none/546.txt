Now , this particular wine was an Australian wine and I 've had a lot of experience with it . When it was opened and brought to the table , you could smell from two foot away that it was corked and it was gone . But that conversation went on with our server for about 45 minutes while he was trying to convince me that it was the chestnut undertone and the waft of blackberry that I could smell .
