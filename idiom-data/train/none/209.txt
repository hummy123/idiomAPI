If there are particular problems with your chest or heart , your surgeon may decide to avoid a cut in your abdomen . In this case you will have a cut below one of your collar bones , and a vertical cut in each groin . An artificial blood vessel made of plastic shaped like an upside down Y will be tunnelled under the skin between these incisions and will be attached to the main blood vessel supplying one arm and to the main blood vessel supplying each leg , ( axillobifemoral graft ) .
