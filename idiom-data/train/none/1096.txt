Under Jarmusch 's expert eye , Murray and a high quality supporting cast take what could have been an episodic , formulaic road movie and shoot it through with genuine human experience . From the beginning , Murray 's edgy stillness betrays Don 's sense of discomfort , and throughout we see a man peeling away the layers of his past and discovering where his past choices have taken him . The humour is wry and bittersweet , rather than laugh out loud funny .
