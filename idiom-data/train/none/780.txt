We toured the town , and Robin guided everyone around the beautiful Cathedral of St. Magnus , as well as the ruined Bishops ' and Earls ' Palaces . Then we went south , crossed the first couple of Churchill Barriers , and had lunch in the sun , by the sand and sea : soporific it was , but.....(oh , all right , I know you can have too much alliteration , and anyway , a Painted Lady , what else , woke us all up ! ) .
