We had already ordered some food and were going to pay for what we had consumed so far but leave to go to Adams Cafe , when the owner came over and asked if there was a problem . We said we wanted to leave and would pay for what had been brought to the table already . He then told us we should leave now , we were barred from the restaurant and we were now trespassing .
