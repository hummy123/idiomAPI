Resources are still sadly limited for adult Aspies in particular , but I am anxious to push things along if given the chance to do so . The highlight of this endeavour , so far , has been my guest speaking engagement at C.R Marchant Middle School , where my friend , Jan Walton teaches . We had a teachersí€Œ¢í‰ä‰åí‰ä‹¢ meeting where I spoke and we brainstormed various ideas on how to make the school environment more suitable for students who have Aspergerí€Œ¢í‰ä‰åí‰ä‹¢s Syndrome .
