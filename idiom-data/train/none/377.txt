And so Christ from his table says to you , to each and every one of us : í‰Œ‡ Come my child í‰äóñ for all your failings , I cannot begin to tell you how infinitely valuable you are to me í‰äóñ í‰Œ‡ Come my child í‰äóñ take bread , take wine í‰äóñ be my guest ! í‰Œ‡ Come my child , offer yourself afresh in my service í‰äóñ for you may not know it yet í‰äóñ but you and I have great things to do together
