On the morning of Thursday the father took a keen-cutting knife and cut the cake into as many sections as there were children in the family , all the sections being equal . All the pieces were then placed in a ' ciosan ' - a beehive basket - and each child blindfold drew a piece of cake from the basket in name of the Father , Son , and Spirit . The child who got the coin got the crop of lambs for the year .
