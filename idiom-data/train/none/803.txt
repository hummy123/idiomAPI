All at various time had a most welcome cup of hot coffee at Sett 's house in Taunton for it was a very cold night . All members who went south are very grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Morris for all the trouble they took to make our weekend so successful . Everyone who went agreed that is was as good as weekend as they had ever spent .
