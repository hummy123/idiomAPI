En route from Heathrow , we stopped off at a self-consciously posh market to enjoy a posh hot dog ( wild venison sausage submerged in olive oil and wrapped in a thick slice of ciabatta ) , and its effects were pretty much immediate . Cocooned within my own bathroom a quarter of an hour later , staring sadly at my reflection in the toilet water , the irony was not lost on me . I had proved admirably resistant to Delhi Belly only to succumb to the Bermondsey Squits .
