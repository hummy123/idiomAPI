This is an old tradition that prevents the cards being marked or doctored before or during play . Between rounds any player may call for more cards to be brought to the table and a fresh pack must be opened in front of everybody . By tradition the player who calls for fresh cards must pay for them but it helps to have a couple of unopened packs in the house .
