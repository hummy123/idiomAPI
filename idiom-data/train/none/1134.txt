This story was related to Price by one of the unmarried sisters , Ethel Bull , who seems to have been the sole source for most of the ghost stories about Borley Rectory . It seems to concern two incidents , one in which he saw the famous coach , and , in the other , he saw a man in the garden . He could only see the man 's legs as the rest of the man 's figure was hidden by the fruit trees .
