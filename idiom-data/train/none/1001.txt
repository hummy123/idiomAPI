It is time we admitted that this country is filled with drug-users . From the granny who sips cannabis tea for her arthritis to the management consultant snorting charlie in the toilets of Stringfellows , from the council estates to the grand estates , we are a nation of druggies . We have to grow up about drugs , and banish the false rhetoric , misleading statistics and silly mythology of the well-meaning but dishonest anti-drugs lobby .
