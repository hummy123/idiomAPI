Read that backwards , in terms of winning order and : \o / -- Thomas Well , he 's wrong about " sh " not having a debugger , particularly since he 's using Bash ; " -x " certainly fits the bill .

As to his length comparisons for different programs - certainly in regard to Perl - he had me cracking up .
