I do ask the people who own it if I can take friends to look at it. **** When we went for a walk every Sunday , we never came back empty handed . Everybody , no matter who they were , even if they were my guests , they all brought back a piece of wood , or a branch of a tree , which was thrown in the shed to be chopped up for the winter . **** Do you remember the glow-worms in the hedges ?
