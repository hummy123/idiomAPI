Turn left and left again for the Six Bells , or left and right for the Waters Edge . If you need a walk and a breath of fresh air then there is a lovely one+ mile walk around the lido , just head for the Waters Edge and you ca n't miss it . I appreciate that you may be reading this page at a time of great sadness , but was it helpful ?
