A few months ago I witnessed a woman and a chap having an argument , withing ten minutes it got physical ! He hit her with the back of his fist accross the face , she retaliated by punching him etc. She then ran and locked herself in the toilets of a pub and asked for the police to be called , which had already been done . The police arrived , separated them both , then asked me what happened ?
