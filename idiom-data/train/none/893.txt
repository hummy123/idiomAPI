This , of course , requires special precision tools ; two Jubilee clips and a small length of lumber . Cost : $ 4 ( though over here , one asks for ' hose clamps ' : saying ' Jubilee clips ' gets you a blank look down at the local DIY center. ) But first there 's a paper gasket that goes under the barrel , which fitsí‰äó_ none too well . Is this a pattern part problem ( not sure of the source of the gasket set ) or is it an age problem ?
