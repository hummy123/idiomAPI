If you want to study gulls in the area you could do no better than the rubbish dump near Yalova . On the south shore of the Marmara Sea the road to Bursa goes south from Yalova , about 5 km south of the town the dual carriageway passes an obvious rubbish dump on a hill to the west of the road . You can turn right onto a road next to the dump , drive up 300m and then turn left straight into the dump .
