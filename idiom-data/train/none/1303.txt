The reason for this is beyond me , as the road is of no better or worse standard than previous sections . Ironically , the local drivers who have been doing 40 mph up to here will now slow down to 30 . We have a few more local turnings and pedestrian crossings before descending to the roundabout at Oadby racecourse where we meet the A6 .
