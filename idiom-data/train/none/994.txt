Gresley TTO 56856 Progress on this third open has been slow , with the main focus of volunteer effort being directed at the HLF project . Work on 56856 has been confined to sanding the saloon ceiling , cutting holes for water pipes in the toilet ceiling and curing some leaks in the roof . While this may sound worrying , the main leak was around the roof tank filler , which had missed having Firecheck applied last year .
