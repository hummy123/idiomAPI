On the 3rd January 2002 it was transported from the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford on its way to the Bristol Aero Collection at Kemble . The rotors have been removed because it would have been too high to go under the motorway bridges ( not to mention too wide ) on its journey . It was exactly 50 years previously to the day on 3rd January 1952 when it took its first test flight , piloted by C.T.D. ( Sox ) Hosegood , who met it at Kemble .
