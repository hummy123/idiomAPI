The Devil 's Ashpit- do n't get too close ! The tour going south took me past the USAF base at Cats Hill where there is a place called the í‰äóÖVolcano Bar ' ( I must try that later ) followed by a quick trip round the south side of Green mountain to a place called Devils Ashpit . This is an extremely deep gully made of what can only be called black ash .
