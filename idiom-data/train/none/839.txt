The A24 , now known as London Road , heads for Ewell , which is now bypassed in a multiplex with the A240 Kingston to Banstead ( for A217 ) road . Coming north , the A24 turns off the A240 , but going south the A240 turns off the A24 , and the A24 then continues into the centre of Epsom and Ashtead . It is primarily because of the lack of bypasses for these towns that A24 traffic from central London is directed to use the A3 to Hook and then the A243 to Leatherhead .
