His longest journey was to Egypt and it was very dusty . This was an event he told me : When he was at school Hitler sent the V2 over and they dropped a bomb in the playground . This was a special day he told me : When it was war , England beat Germany and Roy had V.E. Day which means ' Victory in Europe. ' His special object is a ' Jardinií€ŒÂre ' , which is an ornamental pot for growing plants .
