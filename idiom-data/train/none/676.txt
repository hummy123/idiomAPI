It turns out that Fallujah is a place that knows something about cavalier attitudes , distant rage and the cost in innocent lives . On Feb. 13 , 1991 , in the fourth week of the U.S.-led air war against Iraq , a British Tornado warplane dropped a bomb that was intended to take out a key river bridge at Fallujah . The bomb veered 800 yards off target because of a faulty directional device , British officials later said , and landed in a market instead .
