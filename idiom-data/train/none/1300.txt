I guess what I 'm saying is that there are two different pictures , and maybe that 's the way it should be because in some situations , certainly , you want to teach it from an experimental hands-on approach and then move from this area [ answer oriented ] into this area [ creative ] . Once you get up to here [ creative ] then you 're free . It 's not divorced [ from the algorithmic ] but it 's kind of like a quantum jump , and then you jump right back down again .
