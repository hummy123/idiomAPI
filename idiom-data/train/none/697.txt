For a while , the discovery of the horn of a North American sheep seemed to promise exciting proof of connections between Jarlshof and the New World . In 1941 , a German aircraft had dropped a bomb to the north of the Viking houses , and the horn was found in the sand thrown out of the crater . Alas , excavation ten years later uncovered the remains of a Victorian fisherman 's bothy , making it more likely that this large horn was a souvenir of a 19th century fishing trip .
