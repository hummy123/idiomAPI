How many times have you used a toilet in somewhere such as a pub or restaurant and observed someone else walk straight out after doing their business without stopping to wash their hands ? I ca n't speak for female toilets , but this happens quite regularly in male toilets and especially in the toilets that are in pubs . What bothers me most though is that the doors to these toilets are quite often of the type that you have to push to go in and then pull with a handle to leave .
