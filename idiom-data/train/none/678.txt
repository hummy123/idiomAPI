The Forí€ŒÈt de Bavella extends either side of the pass ( Col de Bavella ) , and has recently been replanted with maritime and Laricio pines following a forest fire in 1960 . There are many sights in the forest , such as the Trou de la Bombe ( bomb hole ) , so called because it looks as if someone has dropped a bomb into the rock , creating a hole 26ft in diameter . Although a walkers paradise , Bavella is worth a visit just for the scenery .
