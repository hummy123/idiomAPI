As you move around , Tingle will occasionally give you hints about dungeon puzzles , and his map of the sea is helpful for finding islands before you 've properly charted a quadrant . Tingle can also heal you , restore your magic , drop a bomb anywhere you put his cursor , and give you the ability to fly for short periods of time . All this extra item- and power-up-based help comes at the cost of a handful of rupees , and it 's never actually required .
