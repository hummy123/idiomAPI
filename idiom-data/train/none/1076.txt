65462 also worked on the Norwich , Yarmouth South Town and East Suffolk lines , with occasional sessions as the Halesworth milk-bay pilot . The loco had its first encounter with the M&GNJRS on the 21st May , 1960 when it assisted a railtour ( from Norwich City to Norwich Thorpe via Sheringham , the Waveney Valley line and Lowestoft ) after the train 's loco , J15 65469 ran out of steam at Beccles . To avoid lost time ( the train was already running late ) 65462 was commandeered from the yard to help the ailing J15.The two locos , coupled tender to tender , then hauled the special as far as Lowestoft Central .
