When you 're leaving Zante it is a nightmare , but now you know you 'll be prepared ( again trying and keep chilled ) . The airport prices for snacks etc are expensive and the departure lounge is packed - the only tip I can give is go downstairs to the toilet area , it 's very cool down there and when we were there there were n't many people ( you 're not actually in the toilets - it 's a corridor outside ) . Good luck - Bev
