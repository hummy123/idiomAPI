I prefer to hark back to the London I first knew when living the other side of The Severn . Thinking , the first time I came here , that if I went south of the river , maybe I 'd see Marlene pushing her buggy , Mickey Pierce in his pork-pie hat and Trigger with his broom . When you 're young , Del Boy and Rodney are real as apples and pears , and they live in a mystical land that is forever Peckham. [ Where Do Only Fools And Horses Work ?
