I rose at just past 4 & was employed in the office arranging some small matters before ye craft came , when I heard a man 's voice calling . I open 'd one of the shutters & saw a man standing about íƒäóì way between my window & the lower gate , and he pointed with his hand and said í‰äóìHere 's a Trow comingí‰äó . I had no doubt in my own mind but that the Trow was very near , & as the wind blew hard & right into the pound it was highly necessary the gates should be opened & ready .
