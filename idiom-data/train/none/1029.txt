Oh so many books , too many to rattle off . I love contemporary fiction but recently I 've been trying to catch up on the classics - that is the books I should have read at school but was too busy sitting in the toilets talking about boys . So I 'm currently listening to an audio book of Moby Dick ( unabridged ) whilst actually reading Girl with a Pearl Earring and Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides .
