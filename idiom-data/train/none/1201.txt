I know Matt Hills ( Cultural studies lecturer who provides the audio commentary and analysis ) and I 'm very aware that the academic focus he brings to bear operates in a quite different way to my own methods . Paul Kane : Oktober was to be made by Zenith a long time ago ; is there any chance that the other novels optioned - such as Down River - might see the light of day now on TVí‰äó_or maybe even as feature films ? How about films such as The Boat House ?
