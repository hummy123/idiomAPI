Although I love where I am now I really want to grow up with a family thats mine , that I can love . The other cats do laugh at me sometimes as I have little a little black moustache and goatee beard that I hear is all the rage ! I love a cuddle , and am very playful like a good kitten should be , and I do n't mind adults , children or other cats .
