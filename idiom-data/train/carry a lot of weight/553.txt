Alternatively , you might like to ask for a Family Group Conference as while it would involve the paternal Nan and the brother amongst others , they are very good at making everyone focus on what is really best for the children involved . If SS and/or the FGC then supported an adoption application , it would carry a lot of weight in court . I agree with the need for eternal youth in this role .
