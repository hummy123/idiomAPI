Yoko Kanno 's score is channelled nicely and plays a large part in the series as it plays throughout much of each episode , as it does so a lot of tension is added to not only the action but also heavy dialogue induced scenes . Gunfire and explosions carry a lot of weight and whiz from front to rear speakers , along with a great assortment of atmospheric sounds . As far as I can tell the problem which plagued the R1 release is not present here .
