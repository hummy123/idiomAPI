The acting in the ADV dub is superb , with none of the characters sounding out-of place or wooden ( something of a rarity í‰äóñ for a long time there was always at least one below-par actor in any dub ) . Christine Auten 's performance as Elvy Hadhiyat ( especially when drunk ) and Chris Patton 's Ayato Kamina ( a notch above his performance in FullMetal Panic ! ) are particularly outstanding .
