Regardless of one 's political colour , or how you feel about the billions of pounds of our taxes being pumped into leaking , unreformed and inefficient public services , nobody can argue that this government has been open and honest about taxation . This is bad enough , but small potatoes compared to the damage being done to the UK 's motivations to save and work hard to increase our standard of living and the country 's prosperity , and to trust our politicians and political system .
