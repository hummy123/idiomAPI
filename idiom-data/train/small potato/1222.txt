I think around 113bhp at the flywheel is typical for your car , which from 90bhp appears piddly , but brings bags of extra torque . Go to the right ' mapper ' and you 'll pay small potatoes for this too . Not sure that larger intercooler alone will help achieve big gains , might need to look at different turbo / wastegates , manifold etc... either way starts adding loads of money - which takes you more into " why do n't I just aim for a 320d " , and so on .
