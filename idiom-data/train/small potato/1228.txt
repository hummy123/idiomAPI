Add to that the declaration by 25 MP 's that they wo n't serve Kennedy . For me , the lying is n't the problem , particularly when this is small potatoes when compared with WMD , as has alreasy been said : the problem is that Kennedy 's campaings have been based on his probity and integrity . That has now been blown out of the water .
