Some have had difficulty in getting their hands on it , I have to say . For instance my sister tried to order multiple copies for Christmas presents through Waterstones ( Leeds ) but was basically told the amount was small potatoes and she 's have to wait indefinitely . She did eventually get them , but not in time for Santa .
