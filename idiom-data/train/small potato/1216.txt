IBPT 's latest project , Trinity Lodge in Back Hamlet , is subject to an application for an amount in excess of í‰Œ£ 200,000 and it is likely that renovation of 45 St Nicholas Street on the comer of Silent Street will also be subject of a substantial bid . Collectively this is still small potatoes compared with grants to projects in , for example , the North-East . So what 's next ?
