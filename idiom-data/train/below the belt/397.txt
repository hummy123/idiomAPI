Hauling themselves from the murk of Paisley in the mid í‰äóÖ'80s , the Church Grims were a gang of street urchins in love with dreams of Rimbaud and James Kirk , and they made a mighty fine sound that left nerves jangling . With a June Brides trumpet and an early James off-kilter skirl , they punched below the belt and kissed above the stars . I loved them dearly , and do so again .
