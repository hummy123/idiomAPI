It 's 1805 and " Lucky " Jack Aubrey is captain of the HMS Surprise , on the trail of a French privateer which has been harrying English shipping . This could have been just a swashbuckler but it 's a cut above that - a believable story told in a compelling way . Russell Crowe and David Threlfall lead a brilliant mostly British cast .
