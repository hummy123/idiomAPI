I 'm a revengeful devil , I know , but , as I remarked some way back , while on the subject of Joan and Chris Ormiston , even a V.O.S. has his self-respect to keep up . I do not think there was a single thing about Jones which did not annoy me - his sleek , auburn hair , which he kept so exquisitely curled - his " hard riding " whiskers - his horrified peach and cream complexion . I compared him with other Green Fusilier Captains I had known - Neave , Masterman .
