He , in the court of law of God , took it on Himself . He went into the melting pot of God 's wrath and fire , He went under the sword of God 's war : ' Jehovah bade His sword awake , Oh Christ , it woke ' gainst Thee ! ' Listen to this : ' I cannot find a man to fill the gap ' , but hallelujah , we can say here at this side of Calvary : ' There is one man , one mediator between God and men - the man Christ Jesus ' - hallelujah !
